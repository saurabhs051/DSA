1. SCC (Strongly connected component)
    1. All nodes in an SCC are reachable from all nodes (i.e. A->B reachable, and B->A reachable, if in same SCC)
    2. This concept is only valid for Directed graphs
    3. A directed graph can be divided into multiple SCCs
2. Algorithms
    1. Kosaraju's Algorithm
    2. Tarjan's Algorithm
