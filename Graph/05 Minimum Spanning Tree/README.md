## Spanning Tree
- A tree with V nodes and V-1 edges and all nodes reachable (connected)
## Minimum Spanning Tree
- The V-1 chosen edges are such that the total cost/weight is minimum.
- **MST is only defined for undirected graphs.**
## Algorithms
- Prim's Algo (Greedy, like Dijkstra)
- Krushkal's Algo (Uses Union-Find)
