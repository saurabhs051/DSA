class Solution {
/* 
 * 1. Min cost to connect all the houses (MST) : n-1 edges
 * 2. Prim's like Dijkstra : BFS + MinHeap (Greedy)
 *      2.1 Unlike Dijksta, But we only consider edge weight, not {node cost + edge weight}
 *      2.2 Unlike Dijksta, here we also need a visited vector, since we only want to get N-1 edges (visit N nodes)
 *      2.3 Unlike normal BFS, visited is checked and marked during pop from queue, not during insert
 * 3. Time Complexity : 
 *      3.1 In this example, dense graph(all to all), Building the adjacency list: O(n^2)
 *      3.2 Prim's algorithm using a min-heap : In sparse graph : O((V + E) log V) time
 *      3.3 But in our case, the graph is complete, i.e. V = n, E = n^2. Hence (~O(n² log n))
 *      3.4 Total : O(n²) + O(n² log n) = O(n² log n)
